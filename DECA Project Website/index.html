            <p>To the Moon is a project dedicated to teaching the students of Marshall Public Schools about managing their money. It is ran by Kolten Gotmer, a senior in high school who created a lesson plan with much needed information. The lesson is taught in just one class period with a short Kahoot! to help students retain the information they were taught, students won't worry anymore about learning money management skills!</p>
